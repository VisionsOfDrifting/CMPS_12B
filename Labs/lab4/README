# The only problem I've been experiencing is that isspace() is grabbing this '^M' as a blank
# space. So the spaces counted is off by 2 and this '^M' character is printed as one of the
# spaces. In the "vim out" view in the console this '^M' is dark blue. I'm assuming it's a
# new line character or some sort of spacing. 
# Anyways, everything else works fine. Program builds without errors.
