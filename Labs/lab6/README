# My program will not compile because of a type errors. I think this is a
# good indication that I am not going about this the correct way. Right now
# the array contains nodes of generic type to hold the variables of generic
# type. I tried it this way because when I tried to load just the generic
# variables into a generic array declared: 
#
# public class List<T> implements ListInterface<T> {...
# private T[] item;
# item = new T[physicalSize]; ...} 
# for both this and the node version I get an error: generic array creation
#
# So I don't understand how I'm supposed to make a list of generic type
# items, with a working index, without an array of the same generic type.
# I assume there is some bit of code somewhere that I am missing like a cast
# or something that would solve this issue.
